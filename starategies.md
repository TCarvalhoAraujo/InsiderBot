# Strategies

## Buy When Executives Buy

The **main idea** is to look for multiple executives buying within a short timeframe. The timeframe will be defined as `10 days`.

The indicator is higher if the insiders are either **C-Class** or **Board Members**.

The price of the purchase matters, so it needs to be a significant amount. It will be taken into consideration `values over $100k`.

This strategie works because **clusters** suggest shared confidence in the company's outlook. 

## Buying Dips + Insider Buy

The **main idea** is to track recent drop in stock prices and an insider buying immediately after the dip. 

Prefer large drops, like `-10% in 5 days`.

Also prefer insiders buying without any historical pattern of doing so.

## Options Activity by Insiders

The **main idea** is to look for `Options Exercised` combined with the insider `not selling` the aquired shares.

Works even better if:
- Insider holds > 1% of the company.
- if the exercise is early (before expiratoion).

## CEO Momentum

The **main idea** is to verify if the CEO is increasing his position, tracking **recurring buyers** and **position size increases**.

## Routine Selling

The **main idea** is to focus on selling breaks from patterns, like a sudden large sale by someone who hasn't sold in a while.

Routine selling **doesn't** apply bearishness.
