## 🧠 Notes

- All price-based tags depend on clean OHLC data. If data is missing or stale, tag application should be skipped.
- Tags are stored as a list in each trade row and can be used to filter, score, or visualize trades.
- For performance, consider caching calculations like insider success rate or cluster patterns.
